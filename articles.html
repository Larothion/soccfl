                    <br> <i>Submitted by Chamber Member Shane McCutchen</i>
                    <br>
                    <br> Now is the time to put tax-planning strategies in place to help reduce your tax liability for 2013. The Bush-era tax cuts expired this year for those in the highest tax brackets, so planning ahead is especially crucial for high-income earners. Married couples filing jointly with taxable income greater than $450,000 face a new 39.6 marginal income tax rate and a 20 percent tax (up from 15) on qualified dividend and long-term capital gains. Also, joint filers earning more than $250,000 will owe a new 3.8 percent Medicare surtax on net investment income.1 Whatever your income, here are some strategies to consider that may help trim your tax bill for 2013.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>1. Make the maximum contribution to retirement accounts</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> Tax-deferred retirement accounts can potentially grow to a substantial sum since they compound over time – tax-free. One added benefit of company-sponsored 401(k) plans is that employers often match contributions. Try to increase your 401(k) contribution to the maximum amount of money allowed ($17,500 for 2013; $23,000 age 50 or older). If you can’t afford that, save at least enough to earn the matching contribution from your employer.2 Making deductible contributions to an IRA also reduces your taxable income for the year. You have until April 15, 2014, to make IRA contributions for 2013: a maximum of $5,500, plus an extra $1,000 if you are age 50 or older</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>2. Defer income</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> If you think you’ll be in the same or lower tax bracket next year, consider deferring some income. While you may not be able to delay wage and salary income, it may be possible to postpone a year-end bonus until next year. Self-employed freelancers or consultants could delay billing some jobs until late December so payments are received next year. You can also defer income by taking capital gains in 2014 instead of in 2013</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>3. Take any last-minute tax deductions</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> Lower your tax bill by accelerating deductions this year. Contributing to charity is a great way to get a deduction. Increase tax benefits by donating appreciated stock or property instead of cash. As long as you’ve owned the asset for more than one year, you get a double tax benefit from the donation: by deducting the property’s market value on the date of the gift, you can avoid paying capital gains tax on the built-up appreciation.3 Keep a receipt to back up any contribution, regardless of the amount. Other expenses that can be accelerated include an estimated state income tax bill due January 15, a property tax bill due early next year, or a hospital or doctor’s bill.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>4. Sell off losers</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> A key year-end strategy is selling investments to realize losses, called “loss harvesting.” Losses can be used to offset any taxable gains you have realized during the year – dollar for dollar. If your losses are more than your gains, you can use up to $3,000 of excess loss to offset other income. Losses exceeding $3,000 can be carried over to next year, offsetting 2014 gains.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>5. Beware the Alternative Minimum Tax </b>
                    <br>
                    <br> The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was designed to keep the wealthy from using legal deductions to drive down their tax bills. The AMT is figured separately from your regular tax liability and with different rules. You pay whichever tax bill is higher. This is a year-end concern since certain expenses deductibles under the regular rules are not deductible under the AMT.2
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>6. Avoid the kiddie tax </b>
                    <br>
                    <br> Congress created the “kiddie tax” rules to prevent families from shifting the tax bill on investment income from the parent’s high tax bracket to the child’s lower bracket. A child’s investment income totaling more than $1,900 is taxed at the parent’s rate until a child turns 19. For a full-time student who provides less than half of his or her own support, the tax applies until the year the child turns age 24</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Can I be of assistance?</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> Concerned about your tax liability for 2013? Let’s arrange a meeting with your tax professional to discuss options for reducing the taxes you owe and to plan ahead for the 2014 tax season.

                            <br>
                            <br> If you itemize deductions on your tax return, you may be able to deduct certain miscellaneous expenses, which might reduce your federal income tax. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at miscellaneous deductions that might benefit you this tax season.
                            <br>
                            <br> <b>Deductions Subject to the Two Percent Limit.</b>
                            <br>
                            <br> You can deduct most miscellaneous expenses only if they exceed two percent of your adjusted gross income. These include expenses such as:<br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Unreimbursed employee expenses.</li>
                        <li> Expenses related to searching for a new job in the same profession.</li>
                        <li> Certain work clothes and uniforms.</li>
                        <li> Tools needed for your job.</li>
                        <li> Union dues.</li>
                        <li> Work-related travel and transportation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <br> <b>Deductions Not Subject to the Two Percent Limit.</b>
                        <br>
                        <br> Some deductions are not subject to the two percent of AGI limit. Some expenses on this list include:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Certain casualty and theft losses.</li>
                            <li> This deduction applies if you held the damaged or stolen property for investment.</li>
                            <li> Property that you hold for investment may include assets such as stocks, bonds and works of art. </li>
                            <li>Gambling losses up to the amount of gambling winnings.</li>
                            <li> Losses from Ponzi-type investment schemes.</li>
                        </ul> Miscellaneous deductions are reported on Schedule A, Itemized Deductions. Be sure to keep records of your deductions as a reminder when you file your taxes in 2014. Keep in mind that many expenses are not deductible. For example, you can’t deduct personal living or family expenses.
